# Sql Server Safe Drop Database

This is a procedure to drop a database.
Out of life’s school of war — Droping a database is not always straightforward.
This procedure was created around 2016 through experimentation.
I do not mean every thing in this procedure is still correct and needed nowadays.

Execute this script on the master database to install.
Check the test file for usage.
